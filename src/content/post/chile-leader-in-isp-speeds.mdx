According to the latest study by [OOKLA](https://www.ookla.com/articles/global-index-internet-speed-growth-2022), Chile has the fastest fixed broadband internet in the world. The country was at the top of the global Speedtest index, ahead of countries like China and Singapore.

The data shows that Chile has a fixed broadband speed of 216.46 megabits per second (Mbps), which surpasses the other countries in the top 10, including China (214.58 Mbps), Singapore (214.23), and Thailand (205.63). This is not the first study to highlight Chile's fast internet speeds. In March 2022, [Uswitch](https://www.uswitch.com/broadband/global-broadband-index/) also placed Chile as the top country in the OECD for fast broadband speeds, with an average download speed of 189.36 Mbps.

Chile is also highlighted in the [Worldwide Broadband Speed League 2022](https://es.statista.com/grafico/18015/paises-latinoamericanos-con-mejor-velocidad-de-internet/) by Statista as the best-positioned country in Latin America and the Caribbean for download speed, though it is ranked 27th globally. Chile's high internet speeds can be attributed to the country's focus on improving and prioritizing fixed and mobile broadband networks. Globally, OOKLA found that mobile download speeds increased by about 17% in the last year, and fixed broadband speeds grew by at least 28%.

Chile's internet speeds also extend to its major cities, with Valparaiso [ranked 2nd in the world](https://www.ookla.com/articles/global-index-cities-announcement) for fixed broadband speed behind Beijing.

Chile is becoming an essential piece for technological innovation and growth. This is further exemplified by the recent launch of [AWS Local Zones](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/aws-launches-local-zones-in-perth-and-santiago/) in Santiago. The company announced that the Local Zones would allow for the delivery of applications that require single-digit millisecond latency or local data processing. This is a significant step forward for Chile and its technology industry. Additionally, it is reported that [Amazon is planning to build a new data center in Puente Alto, Chile](https://www.biobiochile.cl/noticias/economia/negocios-y-empresas/2022/07/27/amazon-inicia-solicitud-para-la-construccion-de-un-datacenter-en-puente-alto.shtml). This will further solidify Chile's position as a leader in technology and innovation.

Another aspect highlighting Chile's commitment to high-speed internet is the widespread availability of affordable and fast fiber internet connections. Many providers offer symmetrical 400Mbps fiber internet connections at a very reasonable cost. Additionally, some providers like [Mundo](https://www.tumundo.cl/fibra-10g/) offer a 10Gbps download link. This availability and accessibility of fast internet is a significant advantage for individuals and businesses in Chile.

Chile's technology industry is on the rise, thanks to its fast internet speeds, commitment to innovation, and the availability of affordable and fast fiber internet connections. The launch of AWS Local Zones and plans for a new data center is a testament to Chile's dedication to being a leader in this field. The future is looking bright for Chile's technology industry.
