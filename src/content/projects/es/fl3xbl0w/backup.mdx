After being freed from `AppMonitorService` (or after any OTA update is received), the first thing to do is back up as much data as possible.

Make sure you're already connected to the tablet:
```sh
> adb connect <Tablet IP Address>
```

## Backup /sdcard contents

It may contain some required files for the machine to work properly after a factory reset (mainly on the `/sdcard/Android` and `/sdcard/Nautilus` folders). We'll back up everything with:
```sh
> adb pull /sdcard/ .
```

## Backup APKs

First, get the list of all packages installed on the tablet (just for you to have a reference):
```sh
> adb shell pm list packages -f
```

They will appear in the following format: `package:<APK location>=<package name>`

You'll have to find the apps you want to backup. NOT ALL APPS ARE REQUIRED, most of them are stock Android apps, and so we'll only search for "non-stock apps" through some filtering:
```sh
> adb shell pm list packages -f | grep -wviE 'com.android|com.google|framework-res|/vendor/overlay'
```

You'll be able to see records for apps from `com.nautilus`, `com.redbend`, `com.netflix`, `com.amazon`, `com.disney` and maybe some more in the future. We'll want to back up everything we see on that list (unique ID's hidden, use your own results):
```sh
> adb shell pm list packages -f | grep -wviE 'com.android|com.google|framework-res|/vendor/overlay'
package:/data/app/com.nautilus.sbctest-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.nautilus.sbctest
package:/data/app/com.redbend.client-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.redbend.client
package:/data/app/com.nautilus.nlssbcsystemsettings-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.nautilus.nlssbcsystemsettings
package:/system/priv-app/RBDualPartService/RBDualPartService.apk=com.redbend.dualpart.service.app
package:/data/app/com.netflix.mediaclient-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.netflix.mediaclient
package:/data/app/com.nautilus.nautiluslauncher-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.nautilus.nautiluslauncher
package:/data/app/com.amazon.avod.thirdpartyclient-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.amazon.avod.thirdpartyclient
package:/data/app/com.nautilus.sbc_demo_app-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.nautilus.sbc_demo_app
package:/data/app/com.nautilus.UtilityApp-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.nautilus.UtilityApp
package:/data/app/com.nautilus.g4assetmanager-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.nautilus.g4assetmanager
package:/data/app/com.nautilus.platform_hardwaretest-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.nautilus.platform_hardwaretest
package:/data/app/com.nautilus.webviewer-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.nautilus.webviewer
package:/data/app/com.nautilus.bowflex.usb-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.nautilus.bowflex.usb
package:/data/app/com.disney.disneyplus-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.disney.disneyplus
```

> NOTE: `com.redbend.dualpart.service.app` comes from `/system/priv-app/`, meaning that it will remain installed even after a factory reset. We can dump it anyways if you are interested in reverse engineering the apps.


Let's take Disney Plus as an example (unique ID hidden)
```
package:/data/app/com.disney.disneyplus-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.disney.disneyplus
```

That line, based on the format I've mentioned, would be:
```
Package location: /data/app/com.disney.disneyplus-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk
Package name: com.disney.disneyplus
```

We'll search for which version of the app we have with that info. Let's use the Package name that we've just identified and run:
```sh
> adb shell dumpsys package com.disney.disneyplus | grep versionName
```

In my case, I've received:
```sh
> adb shell dumpsys package com.disney.disneyplus | grep versionName
    versionName=2.4.2-rc2
```

Now, to create a backup for the Disney Plus package, the procedure would be:
```sh
> adb pull /data/app/com.disney.disneyplus-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk .
```

Immediately after it finishes, go through your File Explorer and rename the just dumped `base.apk` file into `com.disney.disneyplus-2.4.2-rc2.apk`.

The format for APKs that I suggest, given that example, is: `<Package name>-<version>.apk`

Now repeat the process for the rest of the apps.


## Backup AppData
This seems to be able to backup *some (not sure if all)* AppData.

*Note that not all installed apps generate AppData, or we, as the `shell` user, may not have permissions to backup everything.*

Create a full backup of all user-installed apps:
```sh
> adb backup -f appdata.adb -all -noapk -nosystem
```

Alternatively, you can have the same output from an alternative command:
```sh
> adb shell 'bu backup -all -noapk -nosystem' > appdata.adb
```

Both commands will request an "in-screen confirmation" that you want to do a backup. Touch on "**BACK UP MY DATA**":
<Image src={DialogBackupConfirm} alt="backup confirmation screen" format="webp" />

If you want to extract the contents (on Linux, macOS), you'll need `zlib-flate` from [qpdf](https://command-not-found.com/qpdf) and run:
```sh
> dd if=appdata.adb bs=24 skip=1 | zlib-flate -uncompress | tar xf -
```

There is some fascinating data for `com.nautilus.bowflex.usb`.
There is Personally identifiable information (PII) inside, so **make sure to double-check what files you share**.


*These backup and extraction methods are from [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/AnatomicJC/e773dd55ae60ab0b2d6dd2351eb977c1). I've only tested the Backup methods listed there, which are safe to play. **If you play with the Gist Restore, you're on your own**. Let us know if it works tho!*


## Script

I developed a quick and dirty Python script for dumping some contents (it doesn't include AppData for now).
**Only tested on macOS with android-platform-tools installed through brew**.
Read the script, and be sure it makes sense to you before running.

```python
import sys
import os
import subprocess
from datetime import datetime

# check if argument is given
if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Usage: python3 dump.py <Console IP Address>")
    sys.exit(1)

ipaddr = sys.argv[1]

# check if adb is available for shell
adb_path = subprocess.check_output(["which", "adb"]).decode("utf-8").strip()
if not os.path.exists(adb_path):
    print("adb not found")
    exit()

# setup dump folder with current date and time
dump_folder = os.path.join(
    os.environ["HOME"],
    "Desktop",
    "nautilus_dump",
    "{}".format(datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S")),
)
if not os.path.exists(dump_folder):
    os.makedirs(dump_folder)

# connect adb
print("Connecting to {}...".format(ipaddr))
subprocess.call(["adb connect {}".format(ipaddr)], shell=True)

# pull /sdcard contents
print("Pulling /sdcard contents...")
subprocess.call(["adb pull /sdcard/ {}".format(dump_folder)], shell=True)

# get APK info
print("Pulling APKs...")
packages = (
    subprocess.check_output(["adb shell pm list packages -f"], shell=True)
    .decode("utf-8")
    .split("\n")
)

# filter out empty lines
packages = [x for x in packages if x.strip()]

# filter out lines containing "com.android", "com.google", "framework-res"
packages = [package for package in packages if package.find("com.android") == -1]
packages = [package for package in packages if package.find("com.google") == -1]
packages = [package for package in packages if package.find("framework-res") == -1]

print("Found {} APKs".format(len(packages)))

for package in packages:
    package_name = package.split("=")
    package_name = package_name[len(package_name) - 1].strip()
    package_version = (
        subprocess.check_output(
            ["adb shell dumpsys package {} | grep versionName".format(package_name)],
            shell=True,
        )
        .decode("utf-8")
        .split("=")[1]
        .strip()
    )

    package_path = package.split(":")[1].split(".apk=")[0].strip()
    package_path = "{}.apk".format(package_path)
    print("Pulling {} v{}...".format(package_name, package_version))

    subprocess.call(["adb pull {} {}".format(package_path, dump_folder)], shell=True)

    os.rename(
        os.path.join(dump_folder, os.path.basename(package_path)),
        os.path.join(dump_folder, "{}-{}.apk".format(package_name, package_version)),
    )

# backup appdata
print("Backing up appdata.adb ...")
print('TOUCH THE "BACK UP MY DATA" BUTTON ON SCREEN NOW !!!')
subprocess.call(
    ["adb backup -f {}/appdata.adb -all -noapk -nosystem".format(dump_folder)],
    shell=True,
)

# disconnect adb
print("Disconnecting...")
subprocess.check_output(["adb disconnect"], shell=True)
```
