[Proverbia](https://proverbia.net) is a Spanish collection of famous quotes, sayings, proverbs, and aphorisms organized by topic and author. It's a free website for you to visit, but they do not offer any API for its use.

I wanted to develop a Telegram bot that would deliver Proverbia's quote of the day to the user once they sent a message. Therefore, I needed a clean way to programmatically query their quotes.

And so, this project does just that and is a quick and friendly example to demonstrate the capabilities of Puppeteer.
