[OpenHaystack](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack) is an application that allows you to create your own accessories that are tracked by Apple's [Find My network](https://developer.apple.com/find-my/). They have reverse-engineered Apple's protocol and documented it, a quite impressive project.

I wanted to track my electric scooter in case it got stolen. Although the "official" way to build your accessories was "acceptable," it turns out to be quite problematic with several compatibility issues on different Espressif boards.

So I ported it as a component of [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/), a software that I already use for my embedded devices' needs.

## Why ESPHome? Isn't it "for the home"?

I am _a little_ obsessed with keeping my IoT/Embedded devices as up-to-date as possible (and, of course, off any cloud if possible), so ESPHome is an attractive solution to keep your devices updated with Arduino and Espressif frameworks. Through ESPHome, I can "update" my scooter whenever I want.

## Why isn't this an official component?

I tried! I opened [Add support for OpenHaystack #3584](https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/3584), and its [support documentation](https://deploy-preview-2146--esphome.netlify.app/components/openhaystack.html), but understandably they didn't want to merge it.

## ESPHome Example - ESP32

```yaml
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/barrenechea/esphome-config-files
      ref: main
    components: [openhaystack]

esphome:
  name: openhaystack-demo

esp32:
  board: wemos_d1_mini32

wifi:
  ssid: <your-wifi-ssid>
  password: <your-wifi-password>

# Enable logs
logger:

# Enable Home Assistant API
api:

ota:
  password: !secret ota_password

openhaystack:
  # Here goes the OpenHaystack key encoded in Base64
  # I strongly suggest you handle it as a secret
  key: !secret openhaystack_key
```

## ESPHome Example - ESP32-C3

```yaml
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/barrenechea/esphome-config-files
      ref: main

esp32:
  board: esp32-c3-devkitm-1
  variant: ESP32C3
  framework:

    version: latest
    sdkconfig_options:
      CONFIG_FREERTOS_UNICORE: y
      CONFIG_COMPILER_OPTIMIZATION_SIZE: y
      # Enable WPA3 support just because we can
