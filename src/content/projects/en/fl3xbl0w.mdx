Welcome to my documentation of the "Bowflex Console"! (what Nautilus calls Vantron).

Vantron is the basis for most of Nautilus Inc.'s "smart devices". Essentially, an Android tablet running proprietary software. In addition to some hardware-related things that piqued my curiosity.

I relied quite a bit on previous work I found on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bowflex/comments/mi8wdo/unlocking_bowflex_velocore/) (thanks [xasmx](https://www.reddit.com/user/xasmx/)!) to gain a deeper understanding of the machine's software and hardware.

## Compatible Devices (Android Jailbreak)

After playing with the <a href="/en/projects/fl3xbl0w/decompiling" target="_self">decompiled applications</a>, I can say with certainty that the following documentation could be extrapolated in one way or another to the following Bowflex devices:

### Treadmills

- Treadmill 22 / Treadmill 56 (same treadmill. The 56 has a 220v AC input, the 22 has a 120v AC input)
- Treadmill 10 / Treadmill 25 (same treadmill. The 25 has a 220v AC input, the 10 has a 120v AC input)

### Bikes

- VeloCore

### Max Trainer

- Max Total 16
- Max Trainer M9

I don't have a Max Trainer or a VeloCore, but it should work as long as you have an available USB port based on the code findings.

Confirmed to work with NautilusLauncher versions:

- 5.0.0.350
- 5.0.0.382

**The jailbreak has already been patched by Nautilus.**

## Ultimate Goal

To enable as many future upgrades for my treadmill as possible.

Nautilus, Inc. only offers a 1-year warranty on the electronic parts, and as soon as I saw that the mechanism to turn off the machine (and therefore, the Android tablet) was basically "cut the AC power through the rear switch", that scared me. Every Linux-based device should be shut down safely to avoid operating system corruption, and this Android tablet is no exception. So as long as it's running, why not have a little more fun with it?

In the end, I want to intercept, understand, and recreate the communication going to the motor controller on my treadmill so that if the tablet dies, I still have a functioning device.
