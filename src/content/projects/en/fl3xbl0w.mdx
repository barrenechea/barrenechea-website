Welcome to my "Bowflex Console" docs! (what Nautilus refers to as Vantron).

Vantron drives most of the "smart devices" from Nautilus Inc. Basically, an Android tablet running proprietary software. Also some hardware-related stuff that I got curious on.

I heavily relied on some previous work provided over [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bowflex/comments/mi8wdo/unlocking_bowflex_velocore/) (thanks [xasmx](https://www.reddit.com/user/xasmx/)!) to achieve a deeper understanding on the machine's software & hardware.

## Supported devices (Android Jailbreak)

After playing with the <a href="/en/projects/fl3xbl0w/decompiling" target="_self">decompiled apps</a> I can certainly say that the following documentation could be extrapolated in one way or another to the following Bowflex devices:

### Treadmills

- Treadmill 22 / Treadmill 56 (same treadmill. 56 is 220v AC input, 22 is 120v AC input)
- Treadmill 10 / Treadmill 25 (same treadmill. 25 is 220v AC input, 10 is 120v AC input)

### Bikes

- VeloCore

### Max Trainer

- Max Total 16
- Max Trainer M9

I don't own a Max Trainer or a VeloCore, but it should work as long as you have an available USB port based on the codebase findings.

Confirmed to be working with NautilusLauncher versions:

- 5.0.0.350
- 5.0.0.382

**The jailbreak has already been patched by Nautilus.**

## End goal

To enable as much future-proofing to my treadmill as possible.

Nautilus, Inc. only provides a 1-year warranty on the electronics side of things, and as soon as I saw that the mechanism for turning off the machine (and so, the Android tablet) was to basically "cut the AC power through the back switch", that scared me. Every Linux-based device should be safely turned off to avoid OS corruption, and this Android tablet is no exception. So while it's working, why not have some "extra fun" with it?.

In the end, I want to intercept, understand, and recreate the communication going to the Motor Control Board on my treadmill so if the tablet dies, I still have a working device.
