This project began when I was studying Computer Science, and it was just my first attempt to create something useful and related to the things I was involved in at the time.

I was moving away from Java GUI (which sucks) to C#, which allowed me to get involved with [MahApps.Metro](https://mahapps.com/), which I thought was cool in 2015 (compared to the default WinForms).

I launched the project in 2015 on [Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1135816.0) and [Github](https://github.com/barrenechea/AutoDice). What set the app apart was the user interface and a strategy hub, allowing users to upload and share their strategies with others. You can check the Bitcointalk thread for more information.

In 2022, I [updated the project](https://github.com/barrenechea/AutoDice/commit/194cb75cbf924faa50528c8da1b259b2f51213f1) from .NET Framework 4.5 to .NET 6.0 as part of maintenance (and to keep up to date with .NET). I also removed [Costura](https://github.com/Fody/Costura) since it is not the way to package things in .NET 6.0.

Here is a copy of the "infographic" I created at that time for my post on Bitcointalk:
