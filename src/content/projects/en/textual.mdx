[Textual](https://www.codeux.com/textual) is an [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) client for macOS. I discovered IRC when I was a kid. At that time, it blew my mind to be able to communicate with random people from all over the world.

At the beginning of 2022, I installed [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org) on a Ubiquiti Access Point, and I saw that they had an IRC presence on the [OFTC](https://www.oftc.net) network, and I thought that Textual was an excellent IRC client (an "upgrade" from my old [mIRC](https://www.mirc.com)/[IRcap](https://www.ircap.com) combo).

Technically, Textual is free (since it is an open-source project), but it has what they call a "License Manager" whose sole purpose is to support the project's developers. Luckily, it's just a couple of variables that I adjusted during the pipeline execution to deactivate it.

It was just a small fun project for me to test my skills with pipelines and macOS binaries. Textual is cool. You should definitely support them.
