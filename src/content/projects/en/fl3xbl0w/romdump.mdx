title: ROM Dump - fl3xbl0w
description: Reverse engineering project. It started with the Bowflex Treadmill 22 but ended up being generalized for any machine with Android sold by Nautilus Inc. (Nautilus, Bowflex, Schwinn).

### 2024 Update

We have achieved a significant milestone in the project thanks to the community's collaboration! A contributor, [alphab0ing](https://github.com/alphab0ing), has been working on creating a custom ROM for the Bowflex Vantron RK3399 board. You can see more in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/barrenechea/barrenechea-website/issues/20).

It's been over a year since my console received a system update via OTA. I quickly connected via ADB to back up the files (if I could find them), and fortunately, I was successful!

The update was stored in the typical Nautilus working directory, `/sdcard/Nautilus/redbend/`. The extracted files are as follows:

```
1_1_script.rdp
1_delta.rdp
1_suffix.rdp
Credentials.txt
crc.rdp
deltas_header.rdp
dma_config.txt
dp
installation_order.txt
section1.rdp
suffix_section.rdp
```

The file `1_delta.rdp` was particularly large, so I assumed that’s where the magic was. After inspecting the file a bit, I came to this:

```
1_delta.rdp: Java archive data (JAR): Unzip as a .zip
	- payload.bin: Extract with https://github.com/ssut/payload-dumper-go
		- boot.img: Android bootimg, kernel (0x10008000), ramdisk (0x11000000), second stage (0x10f00000), page size: 2048, cmdline (console=ttyFIQ0 androidboot.baseband=N/A androidboot.wificountrycode=US androidboot.veritymode=enforcing androidboot.hardware=r)
		- dtbo.img: data
		- oem.img: Linux rev 1.0 ext2 filesystem data, UUID=b886e36e-ac40-5948-86dd-27c114bd225e, volume name "oem" (extents) (large files) (huge files)
		- system.img: Linux rev 1.0 ext2 filesystem data, UUID=0a7fc206-6c88-5018-bacd-4ea8a11db7ca (extents) (large files) (huge files)
		- trust.img: data
		- uboot.img: data
		- vbmeta.img: data

```

The OTA update files (HP-22_T56_EEA Android OS Image 3.10 release-keys) have been shared on [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/download/HP-22_T56_EEA).

With these files, [alphab0ing](https://github.com/alphab0ing) was able to obtain the original DTS (Device Tree Source) of the device ([download](/HP-22_T56_EEA.dts)). This is crucial for custom ROM development and for better understanding the hardware. Let's see how this progresses!

### Rockchip Loader Mode

An RK3399 processor powers the Android hardware. Rockchip processors come with a "loader mode" as a standard feature.

The toolset I’ve used is:

- Rockchip Driver Assistant v4.5 from [ChinaGadgetsReviews](https://chinagadgetsreviews.com/?s=Rockchip+Driver+Assistant)
- rkDumper 1.09 test from [this XDA post](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/tool-rkdumper-utility-for-backup-firmware-of-rockchips-devices.2915363/page-9#post-84229591)
- Android Tool Release v2.69 from [ChinaGadgetsReviews](https://chinagadgetsreviews.com/?s=android+tool+release)

_There is a newer version of the driver available for download, but it is known to be incompatible with rkDumper._

To play with this, you’ll need to disassemble the Bowflex Console, unscrew the plastic back cover, and reassemble it in a "bare form."
**Do not attempt this, as playing with Android hardware in Loader Mode can lead to a permanently broken device.**

Here are the relevant parts of the Android logic board for Rockchip stuff:

<Image src={VantronPCB} alt="Vantron PCB" format="webp" />

You can keep the Android Tool Release application open at all times as a reference to check what mode the console is in.

With the machine powered on in "normal mode" and connected to a computer, it identifies as `NFTM-LAR`:

```
NFTM-LAR:
  Product ID: 0x0001
  Vendor ID: 0x2207 (Fuzhou Rockchip Electronics Co., Ltd.)
  Version: 3.10
  Speed: Up to 480 Mb/s
  Manufacturer: Vanzo
  Location ID: 0x14120000 / 9
  Current Available (mA): 500
  Current Required (mA): 500
  Extra Operating Current (mA): 0
```

With the machine powered off, connected via USB to a computer, holding down the "Recovery button" and powering it on, it should boot into "Loader mode." The machine will "beep," but the screen will remain static. _You can power off, wait a minute, power on, and the machine will boot normally._

_The Android hardware does not handle the "beep" after powering on the machine, but through the other Nautilus PCBs._

It will now report to the computer as `USB download gadget` (Serial Number hidden):

```
USB download gadget:
  Product ID: 0x330c
  Vendor ID: 0x2207 (Fuzhou Rockchip Electronics Co., Ltd.)
  Version: 99.99
  Serial Number: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  Manufacturer: Rockchip
  Location ID: 0x14120000
```

After running rkDumper against the console, we get information about the partitions:

```
"EFI PART" sign found (RKFP FW dump)

Partition "uboot_a" (0x00002000) saved (format: Rockchip uboot image file)

Partition "video" (0x0047e000) saved (format: unknown)
Partition "userdata" (0x0169bbdf) saved (format: unknown)
```

`uboot_a` and `uboot_b` were successfully extracted, but all other partitions marked as `(format: unknown)` are poorly backed up, only extracting `CC` hexadecimal values from them.

A case similar to mine was documented on [4pda](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?s=&showtopic=614530&view=findpost&p=102427030), and after [asking](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/tool-rkdumper-utility-for-backup-firmware-of-rockchips-devices.2915363/page-11#post-86678625) the rkDumper developer, [he says](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/tool-rkdumper-utility-for-backup-firmware-of-rockchips-devices.2915363/page-11#post-86687085) there must be a new RockChip loader in place. Following this method seems unfeasible for now.

### ADB

Some similar data can be found through adb, but it doesn’t seem possible to back up since we lack root permissions:

```sh
> ls -al /dev/block/platform/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root   60 2022-04-13 19:38 .

### Other Ideas

One thing we can do is desolder the eMMC chip and read it externally to back up all its contents. It would be good for creating a custom ROM, but I won’t desolder the one from my ONLY Console (it would be cool to have a spare).
