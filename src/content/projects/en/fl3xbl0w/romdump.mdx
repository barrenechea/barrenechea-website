title: ROM Dump - fl3xbl0w
description: Reverse engineering project. It started with the Bowflex Treadmill 22 but ended up being generalized for any Android machine sold by Nautilus Inc. (Nautilus, Bowflex, Schwinn).

### Rockchip Loader Mode

An RK3399 processor powers the Android hardware. Rockchip processors come with a standard "loader mode."

The toolkit I have used is:

- Rockchip Driver Assistant v4.5 from [ChinaGadgetsReviews](https://chinagadgetsreviews.com/?s=Rockchip+Driver+Assistant)
- rkDumper 1.09 test from [this XDA post](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/tool-rkdumper-utility-for-backup-firmware-of-rockchips-devices.2915363/page-9#post-84229591)
- Android Tool Release v2.69 from [ChinaGadgetsReviews](https://chinagadgetsreviews.com/?s=android+tool+release)

_There is a newer version of the driver available for download, but it is known to be incompatible with rkDumper._

To play with this, you will have to disassemble the Bowflex Console, unscrew the plastic back cover, and reassemble it in a "bare form."
**Do not attempt this, as playing with Android hardware in Loader Mode can lead to a permanently broken device.**

Here are the relevant parts of the Android logic board for Rockchip stuff:

You can keep the Android Tool Release application open all the time as a reference to check what mode the console is in.

With the machine turned on in "normal mode" and connected to a computer, it identifies as `NFTM-LAR`:

```
NFTM-LAR:
  Product ID: 0x0001
  Vendor ID: 0x2207 (Fuzhou Rockchip Electronics Co., Ltd.)
  Version: 3.10
  Speed: Up to 480 Mb/s
  Manufacturer: Vanzo
  Location ID: 0x14120000 / 9
  Current Available (mA): 500
  Current Required (mA): 500
  Extra Operating Current (mA): 0
```

With the machine turned off, connected via USB to a computer, holding down the "Recovery button" and turning it on, it should boot into "Loader mode." The machine will "sound," but the screen will remain static. _You can turn off, wait a minute, turn on, and the machine will boot normally._

_The Android hardware does not handle the "sound" after turning on the machine, but through the other Nautilus PCBs._

Now it will report on the computer as `USB download gadget` (Serial Number hidden):

```
USB download gadget:
  Product ID: 0x330c
  Vendor ID: 0x2207 (Fuzhou Rockchip Electronics Co., Ltd.)
  Version: 99.99
  Serial Number: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  Manufacturer: Rockchip
  Location ID: 0x14120000
```

After running rkDumper against the console, we get information about the partitions:

```
"EFI PART" sign found (RKFP FW dump)

Partition "userdata" (0x0169bbdf) saved (format: unknown)
```

`uboot_a` and `uboot_b` were successfully extracted, but all other partitions marked as `(format: unknown)` are poorly backed up, only extracting hexadecimal `CC` values from them.

A similar case to mine was documented on [4pda](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?s=&showtopic=614530&view=findpost&p=102427030), and after [asking](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/tool-rkdumper-utility-for-backup-firmware-of-rockchips-devices.2915363/page-11#post-86678625) the rkDumper developer, [he says](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/tool-rkdumper-utility-for-backup-firmware-of-rockchips-devices.2915363/page-11#post-86687085) that there must be a new RockChip loader in place. Following this method seems to be unviable for now.

### ADB

Some similar data can be found through adb, but it does not seem possible to make a backup as we lack root permissions:

```sh
> ls -al /dev/block/platform/
total 0
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root   60 2022-04-13 19:38 .
drwxr-xr-x 5 root root 1300 2022-04-13 19:38 ..

```

```sh

### Other Ideas

Something we can do is desolder the eMMC chip and read it externally to be able to back up all its content. It would be good for creating a custom ROM, but I will not desolder from my ONLY Console (it would be cool to have a spare one).
