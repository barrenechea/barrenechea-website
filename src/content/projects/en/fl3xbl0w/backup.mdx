title: Backing Up the Contents of Your Console - fl3xbl0w

After being released from `AppMonitorService` (or after receiving any OTA update), the first thing to do is to back up as much data as possible.

Make sure you are already connected to the console:

```sh
> adb connect <Console IP Address>
```

## Backup of /sdcard content

It may contain some files necessary for the machine to work properly after a factory reset (mainly in the `/sdcard/Android` and `/sdcard/Nautilus` folders). We will back up everything with:

```sh
> adb pull /sdcard/ .
```

## APK Backup

First, get the list of all the packages installed on the Console (just so you have a reference):

```sh
> adb shell pm list packages -f
```

They will appear in the following format: `package:<APK location>=<package name>`

You will have to find the applications you want to back up. NOT ALL APPLICATIONS ARE NECESSARY, most are standard Android applications, so we will only look for "non-standard applications" using some filters:

```sh
> adb shell pm list packages -f | grep -wviE 'com.android|com.google|framework-res|/vendor/overlay'
```

You will see records of applications from `com.nautilus`, `com.redbend`, `com.netflix`, `com.amazon`, `com.disney`, and perhaps some more in the future. We will want to back up everything we see on that list (hidden unique IDs, use your own results):

```sh
> adb shell pm list packages -f | grep -wviE 'com.android|com.google|framework-res|/vendor/overlay'
package:/data/app/com.nautilus.sbctest-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.nautilus.sbctest
package:/data/app/com.redbend.client-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.redbend.client
package:/data/app/com.nautilus.nlssbcsystemsettings-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.nautilus.nlssbcsystemsettings
package:/system/priv-app/RBDualPartService/RBDualPartService.apk=com.redbend.dualpart.service.app
package:/data/app/com.netflix.mediaclient-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.netflix.mediaclient
package:/data/app/com.nautilus.nautiluslauncher-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.nautilus.nautiluslauncher
package:/data/app/com.amazon.avod.thirdpartyclient-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.amazon.avod.thirdpartyclient
package:/data/app/com.nautilus.sbc_demo_app-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.nautilus.sbc_demo_app
package:/data/app/com.nautilus.UtilityApp-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.nautilus.UtilityApp
package:/data/app/com.nautilus.g4assetmanager-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.nautilus.g4assetmanager
package:/data/app/com.nautilus.platform_hardwaretest-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.nautilus.platform_hardwaretest
package:/data/app/com.nautilus.webviewer-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.nautilus.webviewer
package:/data/app/com.nautilus.bowflex.usb-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.nautilus.bowflex.usb
package:/data/app/com.disney.disneyplus-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.disney.disneyplus
```

> NOTE: `com.redbend.dualpart.service.app` comes from `/system/priv-app/`, which means it will remain installed even after a factory reset. We can back it up anyway if you are interested in reverse engineering the applications.

Let's take Disney Plus as an example (hidden unique ID)

```
package:/data/app/com.disney.disneyplus-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk=com.disney.disneyplus
```

That line, based on the format I've mentioned, would be:

```
Package location: /data/app/com.disney.disneyplus-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk
Package name: com.disney.disneyplus
```

We will look for what version of the application we have with that information. Let's use the Package name we just identified and run:

```sh
> adb shell dumpsys package com.disney.disneyplus | grep versionName
```

In my case, I received:

```sh
> adb shell dumpsys package com.disney.disneyplus | grep versionName
    versionName=2.4.2-rc2
```

Now, to create a backup for the Disney Plus package, the procedure would be:

```sh
> adb pull /data/app/com.disney.disneyplus-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/base.apk .
```

Immediately after it finishes, go to your File Explorer and rename the newly backed up `base.apk` file to `com.disney.disneyplus-2.4.2-rc2.apk`.

The format I suggest for APKs, given that example, is: `<Package name>-<version>.apk`

Now repeat the process for the rest of the applications.

## AppData Backup

It seems to be able to back up _some (I'm not sure if all)_ application data.

_Keep in mind that not all installed applications generate application data, or we, as the `shell` user, may not have permissions to back up everything._

Create a full backup of all user-installed applications:

```sh
> adb backup -f appdata.adb -all -noapk -nosystem
```

Alternatively, you can get the same result from an alternative command:

```sh
> adb shell 'bu backup -all -noapk -nosystem' > appdata.adb
```

Both commands will request an "on-screen confirmation" that you want to make a backup. Tap on "**BACK UP MY DATA**":

<Image
  src={DialogBackupConfirm}
  alt="backup confirmation screen"
  format="webp"
/>

If you want to extract the contents (on Linux, macOS), you will need `zlib-flate` from [qpdf](https://command-not-found.com/qpdf) and run:

```sh
> dd if=appdata.adb bs=24 skip=1 | zlib-flate -uncompress | tar xf -
```

There is some fascinating data for `com.nautilus.bowflex.usb`.
There is personally identifiable information (PII) inside, so **make sure to check well what files you share**.

_These backup and extraction methods come from [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/AnatomicJC/e773dd55ae60ab0b2d6dd2351eb977c1). I have only tested the backup methods listed there, which are safe to play with. **If you play with the Restoration from the Gist, you're on your own**. Let us know if it works!_

## Script

I developed a quick and dirty Python script to back up some contents (it does not include AppData for now).
**Only tested on macOS with android-platform-tools installed via brew**.
Read the script and make sure it makes sense to you before running it.

```python
import sys
import os
import subprocess
from datetime import datetime

# check if an argument was given
if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Usage: python3 dump.py <Console IP Address>")
    sys.exit(1)

ipaddr = sys.argv[1]

# check if adb is available for shell
adb_path = subprocess.check_output(["which", "adb"]).decode("utf-8").strip()
if not os.path.exists(adb_path):
    print("adb not found")
    exit()

# set up backup folder with current date and time
dump_folder = os.path.join(
    os.environ["HOME"],
    "Desktop",
    "nautilus_dump",
    "{}".format(datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S")),
)
if not os.path.exists(dump_folder):
    os.makedirs(dump_folder)

# connect adb
print("Connecting to {}...".format(ipaddr))
subprocess.call(["adb connect {}".format(ipaddr)], shell=True)

# backup content of /sdcard
print("Backing up content of /sdcard...")
subprocess.call(["adb pull /sdcard/ {}".format(dump_folder)], shell=True)

# get APK information
print("Backing up APKs...")
packages = (
    subprocess.check_output(["adb shell pm list packages -f"], shell=True)
    .decode("utf-8")
    .split("\n")
)

# filter out empty lines
packages = [x for x in packages if x.strip()]

# filter out lines containing "com.android", "com.google", "framework-res"
packages = [package for package in packages if package.find("com.android") == -1]
packages = [package for package in packages if package.find("com.google") == -1]
packages = [package for package in packages if package.find("framework-res") == -1]

print("Found {} APKs".format(len(packages)))

for package in packages:
    package_name = package.split("=")
    package_name = package_name[len(package_name) - 1].strip()
    package_version = (
        subprocess.check_output(
            ["adb shell dumpsys package {} | grep versionName".format(package_name)],
            shell=True,
        )
        .decode("utf-8")
        .split("=")[1]
        .strip()
    )

    package_path = package.split(":")[1].split(".apk=")[0].strip()
    package_path = "{}.apk".format(package_path)
    print("Backing up {} v{}...".format(package_name, package_version))

    subprocess.call(["adb pull {} {}".format(package_path, dump_folder)], shell=True)

    os.rename(
        os.path.join(dump_folder, os.path.basename(package_path)),
        os.path.join(dump_folder, "{}-{}.apk".format(package_name, package_version)),
    )

# backup appdata
print("Backing up appdata.adb ...")
print('TAP THE "BACK UP MY DATA" BUTTON ON SCREEN NOW !!!')
subprocess.call(
    ["adb backup -f {}/appdata.adb -all -noapk -nosystem".format(dump_folder)],
    shell=True,
)

# disconnect adb
print("Disconnecting...")
subprocess.check_output(["adb disconnect"], shell=True)
```
