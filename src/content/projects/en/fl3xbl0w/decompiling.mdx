This assumes that you already [have your own APKs](/en/projects/fl3xbl0w/backup). Keep in mind that, although I am specifying this for Nautilus apps, this applies to virtually any Android app you want to "take a peek under the hood".

## Converting apps into Java code

The following instructions aim to obtain "readable code", but it is unlikely that you will be able to compile them back into an APK. I am using this as a reference to understand Nautilus developers. If you want to modify the codebase and repackage it, go to [Converting apps into Smali code](#converting-apps-into-smali-code).

### Requirements

- [jadx](https://github.com/skylot/jadx)

### Let's open some stuff!

After installing `jadx`, you should be able to open `jadx-gui`. Go to File -> Open files...

<Image src={JadxGUIScreen} alt="jadx-gui screen" format="webp" />

Look for the APK you want and click on "Open file":

<Image src={JadxGUISelect} alt="jadx-gui selecting apk" format="webp" />

And from there, you can start poking around:

<Image
  src={JadxGUIOpened}
  alt="jadx-gui decompiling NautilusLauncher"
  format="webp"
/>

If you want to save the project as Java files, go to File -> Save as gradle project:

<Image src={JadxGUISave} alt="jadx-gui saving project" format="webp" />

If useful, here are my `jadx-gui` preferences:

## Converting apps into Smali code

The community has tested [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bowflex/comments/mi8wdo/unlocking_bowflex_velocore/) to apply some patches to our APKs. It would only work for non-system apps, as without the proper signing key, the app will not have access to system resources (like the Serial port).
