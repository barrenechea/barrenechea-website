If you've been here before, this website has been with the "hi there" message for a few years. A lot has changed over the years tho!

<Image src={OldWebsiteImage} alt="Screenshot of how the website used to look like" format="webp" />

The website back in 2016 was allocated in a [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) droplet. Later,
I decided to open up ports within my own network and used [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/barrenechea/barrenechea-website)
to run the website within my [Unraid](https://unraid.net) server.

Before switching to Edge deployments for it, I used a [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel)
to alleviate the dynamic IP nature of my ISP and reinforce my local network's "reachability points".

What you are reading right now is a rebuild of the website, powered by [Astro](https://astro.build). It's ability
to deploy to the Edge (I'm currently leveraging Cloudflare's [edge network](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/edge-server/)) is a huge improvement both from the security perspective
and the resulting performance for the end-users (you!).

The font I chose for this website is ~~[JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) üë®üèª‚Äçüíª~~ [Work Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans).
