If you've been around here before, this website has had the "hi there" message for a few years. But a lot of things have changed over time!

The website back in 2016 was hosted on a [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com) droplet. Later,
I decided to open ports within my own network and used [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/barrenechea/barrenechea-website)
to run the website on my [Unraid](https://unraid.net) server.

Before switching to Edge deployments, I used a [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/tunnel/)
to alleviate the dynamic IP nature of my ISP and to reinforce the "accessibility points" of my local network.

What you're reading now is a rebuild of the website, powered by [Astro](https://astro.build). Its ability
to deploy on the Edge (I'm currently leveraging Cloudflare's [edge network](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/edge-server/)) is a huge improvement both from a security perspective
and the resulting performance for end-users (you!).

The font I chose for this website is ~~[JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) üë®üèª‚Äçüíª~~ [Work Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans).
