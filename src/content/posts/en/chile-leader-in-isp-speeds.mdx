According to the latest study by [OOKLA](https://www.ookla.com/articles/global-index-internet-speed-growth-2022), Chile has the world's fastest fixed broadband internet. The country topped the global Speedtest index, ahead of countries like China and Singapore.

The data shows that Chile has a fixed broadband speed of 216.46 megabits per second (Mbps), which surpasses other countries in the top 10, including China (214.58 Mbps), Singapore (214.23), and Thailand (205.63). This is not the first time a study has highlighted Chile's fast internet speeds. In March 2022, [Uswitch](https://www.uswitch.com/broadband/global-broadband-index/) also placed Chile as the leading country in the OECD in terms of fast broadband speeds, with an average download speed of 189.36 Mbps.

Chile is also highlighted in Statista's [2022 World Broadband Speed League](https://es.statista.com/grafico/18015/paises-latinoamericanos-con-mejor-velocidad-de-internet/) as the best-positioned country in Latin America and the Caribbean in download speed, although globally it is ranked 27th. Chile's high internet speeds can be attributed to the country's focus on improving and prioritizing fixed and mobile broadband networks. Globally, OOKLA found that mobile download speeds increased by approximately 17% last year, and fixed broadband speeds grew by at least 28%.

Chile's internet speeds also extend to its major cities, with Valpara√≠so [ranked 2nd in the world](https://www.ookla.com/articles/global-index-cities-announcement) in fixed broadband speed behind Beijing.

Chile is becoming an essential piece for innovation and technological growth. This is further exemplified by the recent launch of [AWS Local Zones](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/aws-launches-local-zones-in-perth-and-santiago/) in Santiago. The company announced that the Local Zones would enable the delivery of applications requiring single-digit millisecond latency or local data processing. This is an important step for Chile and its tech industry. Additionally, it is reported that [Amazon plans to build a new data center in Puente Alto, Chile](https://www.biobiochile.cl/noticias/economia/negocios-y-empresas/2022/07/27/amazon-inicia-solicitud-para-la-construccion-de-un-datacenter-en-puente-alto.shtml). This will further consolidate Chile's position as a leader in technology and innovation.

Another aspect that highlights Chile's commitment to high-speed internet is the wide availability of fast and affordable fiber connections. Many providers offer symmetrical fiber connections of 400Mbps at a very reasonable cost. Furthermore, some providers like [Mundo](https://www.tumundo.cl/fibra-10g/) offer a 10Gbps download link. This availability and affordability of fast internet is a significant advantage for individuals and businesses in Chile.

Chile's tech industry is on the rise, thanks to its fast internet speeds, commitment to innovation, and the availability of fast and affordable fiber connections. The launch of AWS Local Zones and plans for a new data center are a testament to Chile's dedication to being a leader in this field. The future looks promising for Chile's tech industry.
