In 2010, AdeS (an Argentinian brand of juice later purchased by Coca-Cola Company in 2016) made a contest over Facebook.
It was a 4x4 puzzle game where you could win a Nintendo Wii. The conditions to win the prize were:
- Do it in the least amount of time, and
- Do it in the least amount of moves

I wouldn't say I'm particularly good at 4x4 puzzles, but it sounded like a good challenge to work around it.

The game's first seconds displayed the solution (the fully formed picture), and then it was scrambled.

I don't have the original image, but here's a stock photo for you to have a reference:

There was something particular about the game tho: The timer started to count AFTER you made your first move, leaving you the chance to
"think" about it before you start playing.

After staring at the picture, I made a "side image" to play with, replacing the scrambled pictures with numbers.
That way, it was easier to figure out "how to sort it from 1 to 15":

<Image src={PuzzleNumbered} alt="two puzzles side by side, the solution on the left and a scrambled version on the right, with numbers overlay" format="webp" />

My brain liked it more that way... Buuut, I didn't want to spend too much time on this, so I searched for a puzzle solver. After a few hours, I
found one that worked through brute force, taking quite some time to give you better and better solutions. It gave you several number sequences
to follow after some time, and then you could solve the puzzle.

I spent a lot of time searching for a "good scrambled puzzle" because I wanted it to be solved in less than 20 moves if possible.
After a few days and several restarts of the Facebook game, **I had a solution within 16 moves**.

I overcomplicated after this because of the two constraints of the puzzle - moves count **AND** time. I used an auto-clicker app, where I screenshotted the
scrambled puzzle and then "solved" the puzzle by following the best number sequence.

Everything was ready to go.

I click on "Start" within the auto-clicker app.

Autoclicker fails at the middle of the puzzle ðŸ’€

I messed up by making the auto-clicker go too fast, and a click did not register within the game. I quickly jumped in, fixed a few misclicked tiles, and finished
the sequence manually. My final mark was **21 moves in 15 seconds**.

A few days before the due date, I checked the leaderboards, and the second-place player solved it in around 300 moves and 20 minutes.
It wasn't even a competition at that point.

After a few days, I got notified through Facebook that I had won. Yay! ðŸŽ‰

Here's a video taken at the place when I picked up the console:

## From Wii to Xbox 360

I wanted to play [Alan Wake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Wake) so bad! So I never thought about keeping the Wii, so I quickly published it
on an online forum (rest in peace, CHW ðŸª¦), I could sell it, purchase an Xbox 360, or trade it right away.

And some guy writes me wanting to trade his newly received 360 for a Wii! Isn't this world a beauty sometimes?

It turns out he won his Xbox 360 playing online poker! It was a PAL console (we're NTSC here in Chile), so that was a bummer, but
I trade it anyways. I wanted to unlock it after all, so I could play backups. PAL games were a torrent away.

_Sorry, pirated games were the way for me to play new games then. Thank you, Microsoft!_

## Unlocking it and to the moon ðŸš€

I found a thread within the same forum where someone unlocked Xbox 360's (darcito was his username). I went to his house (that's where he worked)
and saw the unlocking process from a few meters away.

"You're kidding? He's just connecting the DVD drive to his computer through SATA and clicking some buttons? I can do that ðŸ’© by myself!"

### Optical Drives

And so, for the next few months, I learned on the internet about how the unlocking process works. Xbox 360's have several optical drives
vendors, different firmware revisions, and for each one, you had a unique unlocking method, but everything around dumping the console's unique
DVD Key and flashing the drive with a custom firmware developed by c4eva.

By the end of the year, I copied darcito's strategy and opened my thread within the forum, unlocking consoles in my own home.
Several Xbox modders powered the DVD drive with the same console, but the community thought that Microsoft could detect if the console was powered on
without the DVD drive plugged in, your console was "flagged" (not sure if that was right or not).

Anyways, I wanted to protect my client's consoles from being flagged, so I developed a custom power supply with switches for specific voltage
lines (required to unlock some optical drives):

Of course, after some time, they were better retail options for modders, so eventually, I got an X360 USB Pro v2 from Team Xecuter.

#### Drilling chips (Kamikaze method)

This unlocking method for optical drives was wild; I'm not going to lie! For Xbox 360 Slims coming with locked LiteOn DG-16D4S drives AND Winbond chips
(they were LiteOn drives with MXIC chips that didn't require this) you had to make a hole on a chip inside the DVD drive with a drill.

What we tried to achieve with Kamikaze was to reach a teeny tiny wire and pull it to ground, allowing you to flash a custom firmware into the drive:

I guess Microsoft wasn't expecting this kind of craziness to play backups. Never underestimate the power of hackers.
A funny message that I found on Twitter related to this:

> MS: Okay, if we connect the write protect from *inside* the package with bond wire, they can't just cut a pin or trace

> Modders: Hold my chip drilling alignment jig

### Reset Glitch hack

On August 28, 2011, GliGli and Tiros (with help from cOz) released the Reset Glitch Hack (or RGH) for the Xbox 360. It is an unpatchable hardware
exploit to run unsigned code. After a few days, the Xbox 360 scene was slowly making tools for modders to patch the console. You needed
to be handy with the soldering iron tho.

Finding compatible chips for you in the early days was tough, but I found a few that worked.
Nowadays, you don't even require a chip with RGH 3.0.

Here's a picture of me booting Linux (the couch you see there was where my customers used to wait):

<Image src={X360Linux} alt="an Xbox 360 running Linux" format="webp" />

I genuinely believe I was one of the first to offer the RGH service here in Chile. I attended customers across the country for both
optical drive unlocks and RGH. Walking to the mailing office with Xbox 360s was a weekly routine for a long time. Crazy, funny times.

A backup of my services' feedback is still alive [here](https://www.capa9.net/temas/feedback-de-sbarrenechea.899146/).
I met many very nice people and still keep in touch with them. All of that is because of the AdeS juice.
