[Proverbia](https://proverbia.net) is a Spanish collection of famous phrases, quotes, proverbs, and sayings organized by subject and author. It is a free website for you to go and see, but they don't provide any API for you to use.

I wanted to develop a Telegram bot that delivered the Proverbia's quote of the day to the user once it delivered a message. So I required a clean way to query their quotes programmatically.

And so this project does precisely that and is a quick and friendly example to show off Puppeteer's capabilities.
