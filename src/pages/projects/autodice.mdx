This project started when I was studying Computer Science, and it was just my first attempt at making something useful and related to stuff I was involved in at that time.

I was going out from Java GUI (which sucks) to C#, which allowed me to get involved with [MahApps.Metro](https://mahapps.com/), which I considered back in 2015 as pretty as f\*\*k (compared to stock WinForms).

I released the project back on 2015 on [Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1135816.0) and [Github](https://github.com/SebastianBar/AutoDice). The app's differentiator was the UI, and a strategies hub, enabling users to upload and share their strategies with other users. you can check the Bitcointalk thread for more information.

On 2022, I've [updated the project](https://github.com/SebastianBar/AutoDice/commit/194cb75cbf924faa50528c8da1b259b2f51213f1) from .NET Framework 4.5 into .NET 6.0 as housekeeping (and to keep me up-to-date with bootstrapping .NET projects). I also removed [Costura](https://github.com/Fody/Costura) since it's not the way to bundle stuff in .NET 6.0.

Here's a copy of the "infographic" I created at that time for my Bitcointalk post:
