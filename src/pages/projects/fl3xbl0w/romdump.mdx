### Rockchip Loader Mode

An RK3399 processor powers the Android hardware. Rockchip processors come with a "loader mode" as a standard feature.

The toolset that I've used is:
- Rockchip Driver Assistant v4.5 from [ChinaGadgetsReviews](https://chinagadgetsreviews.com/?s=Rockchip+Driver+Assistant)
- rkDumper 1.09 test from [this XDA post](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/tool-rkdumper-utility-for-backup-firmware-of-rockchips-devices.2915363/page-9#post-84229591)
- Android Tool Release v2.69 from [ChinaGadgetsReviews](https://chinagadgetsreviews.com/?s=android+tool+release)

*There is a newer driver version available for download, but it's known to be incompatible with rkDumper.*

In order to play with this, you'll have to unmount the Bowflex Console, unscrew the plastic back cover, and mount it back in a "naked form".
**Do not attempt this, as playing with the Android hardware in Loader Mode can lead to a permanently bricked device.**

Here are the relevant parts of the Android logic board for Rockchip stuff:

You can have the Android Tool Release app opened at all times as a reference to check on which mode the tablet is at.

With the machine turned on in "normal mode" and plugging it into a computer, it identifies itself as `NFTM-LAR`:
```
NFTM-LAR:
  Product ID: 0x0001
  Vendor ID: 0x2207 (Fuzhou Rockchip Electronics Co., Ltd.)
  Version: 3.10
  Speed: Up to 480 Mb/s
  Manufacturer: Vanzo
  Location ID: 0x14120000 / 9
  Current Available (mA): 500
  Current Required (mA): 500
  Extra Operating Current (mA): 0
```

Having the machine turned off, plugged in through USB to a computer, keeping the "Recovery button" pressed and turning it on, it should boot in "Loader mode". The machine will "chime", but the screen will remain static. *You can turn off, wait a minute, turn it on, and the machine will boot normally.*

*The Android hardware does not handle the "chime" after turning the machine on, but through Nautilus' other PCB's.*

It will now report itself in the computer as `USB download gadget` (hidden Serial Number):
```
USB download gadget:
  Product ID: 0x330c
  Vendor ID: 0x2207 (Fuzhou Rockchip Electronics Co., Ltd.)
  Version: 99.99
  Serial Number: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  Manufacturer: Rockchip
  Location ID: 0x14120000
```

After running rkDumper against the console, we get some information regarding partitions:
```
"EFI PART" sign found (RKFP FW dump)

Partition "userdata" (0x0169bbdf) saved (format: unknown)
```

`uboot_a` and `uboot_b` were successfully extracted, but all other partitions marked as `(format: unknown)` are improperly dumped, only extracting hex `CC` values from it.

A similar case to mine was documented over [4pda](https://4pda.to/forum/index.php?s=&showtopic=614530&view=findpost&p=102427030), and after [asking](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/tool-rkdumper-utility-for-backup-firmware-of-rockchips-devices.2915363/page-11#post-86678625) the developer of rkDumper, [he says](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/tool-rkdumper-utility-for-backup-firmware-of-rockchips-devices.2915363/page-11#post-86687085) a new RockChip loader must be in place. Going through this method seems to be a no-go for now.


### ADB

Some similar data can be found through adb, but no dump seems to be possible as we lack root permissions:

```sh
> ls -al /dev/block/platform/

drwxr-xr-x 3 root root   60 2022-04-13 19:38 .

### Other ideas

Something that we can do is to unsolder the eMMC chip and read it externally so that we can dump all contents. It would be good to bake a CFW, but I'll not unsolder it from my ONLY Console (a spare one would be niiice).
