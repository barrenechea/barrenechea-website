**_TL;DR: In an attempt to unify my presence on the internet, I successfully went through the INAPI trademark registration process here in Chile._**

I've been the owner of the `barrenechea.cl` domain since 2016, and I've been using it since then.
Custom mail address, integration with my HomeServer, and this blog you're reading. It certainly has its place in the world of the internet.

But having a domain is not good enough to justify requesting specific username ownership across the internet. It would be best if you had trademark ownership.

After a bit of back and forth, my trademark request went into "Diario Oficial" from the Republic of Chile.
Available since July 8, 2022 [over here](https://www.diariooficial.interior.gob.cl/publicaciones/2022/07/08/43297/06/2151601.pdf).

My INAPI registration currently covers two trademark classes:

- **Class 35:** Advertising, Business, and Retail Services. Allows usage on any communication media within Class 35.
- **Class 42:** Computer and Software Services and Scientific Services. Allows for scientific and technological services and research and design relating thereto; industrial analysis and research services; design and development of computer hardware and software.

INAPI is in constant collaboration with [WIPO](https://www.wipo.int) and [Prosur](https://prosur.org) for international affairs.
[On July 4, 2022, INAPI announced](https://www.inapi.cl/sala-de-prensa/detalle-noticia/comienza-a-regir-en-chile-el-sistema-de-madrid-para-el-registro-internacional-de-marcas) that the "Sistema de Madrid" is opened for business.

## Ripple effect

- **{formatDate(new Date('2022-08-11T13:56:00-0400'))}**: GitHub Trust & Safety Team releases the `barrenechea` username for my use.
