Mellanox cards from Nvidia do not support ASPM (Active State Power Management), a power management feature that helps reduce the power consumption of PCI Express (PCIe) devices. This is a problem because Mellanox cards are used in many high-performance computing (HPC) systems, which often have a large number of PCIe devices that can contribute significantly to the power consumption of the system.

But why does this matter? One of the main reasons is because of the environmental impact of power consumption. HPC systems can consume a large amount of electricity, which generates greenhouse gases and contributes to climate change. By improving the power efficiency of these systems, we can help reduce their carbon footprint and do our part to protect the environment.

ASPM is a valuable power management feature that can significantly reduce the power draw of a system by allowing devices to enter a low-power state when they are not in use. If Mellanox cards supported ASPM, it could improve the power efficiency of HPC systems and reduce their carbon emissions. This would be a win-win situation: not only would it help reduce our impact on the environment, but it would also save money on electricity bills and improve the performance of HPC systems by reducing power-related bottlenecks.

Unfortunately, despite user requests, Nvidia has not provided firmware updates to enable ASPM support in Mellanox cards. This is a disappointment, as it would be a simple and effective way to improve the power efficiency of HPC systems. It is unclear why Nvidia has not provided these updates, but the manufacturer needs to consider this issue and consider providing the necessary firmware updates.

In the meantime, we need to continue exploring ways to improve the power efficiency of HPC systems and reduce their environmental impact. This may include using more efficient hardware, optimizing software and algorithms, and implementing other power management techniques. For example, some HPC systems use power capping or dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) to limit the power consumption of individual components.

By focusing on energy-efficient technologies and practices, we can help reduce the carbon footprint of HPC systems and make a positive impact on the world.
